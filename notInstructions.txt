Next Steps Available
Resolve Smart Contract Build Issue (when network/toolchain is ready)
Step 4: Frontend-Backend Integration - Connect React Native to smart contracts
Step 5: NFC Implementation - Implement actual NFC tipping using Seeker's hardware
Step 6: Testing & Deployment - Unit tests, integration tests, and deployment
The foundation is solid and we have a fully functional frontend ready to integrate with 
the smart contracts once the build issue is resolved. Would you like to proceed with any 
of the next steps, or would you prefer to focus on resolving the smart contract build issue first?
