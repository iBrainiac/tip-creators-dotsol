Development Plan: Decentralized Social Tipping PlatformObjectiveDevelop an Android app for the Solana Seeker phone that enables users to tip creators exclusively in BONK via Solana Pay using QR codes or NFC, with a “vibe score” system to gamify content curation by rewarding users with BONK. The app integrates with the Seeker’s Seed Vault and Solana dApp Store, emphasizing decentralization and low-cost transactions.1. Project ScopeCore Features:Instant tipping in BONK using Solana Pay (QR code/NFC).
QR code generation for creators to receive BONK tips.
Vibe score system: Users earn BONK for curating high-quality content (e.g., upvoting tipped posts).
Secure wallet integration via Mobile Wallet Adapter and Seed Vault.
Simple UI for browsing creators, tipping, and viewing transaction history.

BONK Integration: Micro-tipping in BONK for viral content; leaderboard for top tippers earning additional BONK rewards.
Target Platform: Android 14 (API 34) for Solana Seeker, deployable on Solana dApp Store.
Tech Stack:Frontend: React Native (for rapid development and Seeker compatibility).
Backend: Solana blockchain (Rust/Anchor for smart contracts, if needed).
APIs: Solana Web3.js, Mobile Wallet Adapter, Solana Pay SDK.
Storage: On-chain for transactions, off-chain (e.g., Helius API) for metadata.

2. Development PhasesPhase 1: Setup & ArchitectureDefine app architecture: React Native with Solana Web3.js, Mobile Wallet Adapter, and Solana Pay.
Set up development environment: Android Studio, Solana CLI, ARM64 v8a emulator (Android 14).
Create wireframes for core screens: Home (creator list), Tipping, QR Scanner, Vibe Score, Wallet.
Initialize project repo and configure Solana devnet account.
Deliverable: Project repo set up, wireframes completed.

Phase 2: Core FunctionalityImplement wallet connection using Mobile Wallet Adapter for Seeker’s Seed Vault.
Build Solana Pay integration for BONK tipping (QR code generation/scanning).
Develop smart contract (Rust/Anchor) for vibe score system: track upvotes and distribute BONK rewards.
Create basic UI: Home screen with creator list, tipping button, and QR scanner.
Deliverable: MVP with wallet connection, BONK tipping flow, and vibe score contract on devnet.

Phase 3: Feature ExpansionAdd NFC-based tipping using Seeker’s hardware (Android NFC API).
Implement leaderboard for top tippers in BONK, with additional BONK rewards for top ranks.
Integrate off-chain metadata storage (e.g., Helius API) for creator profiles and tipping history.
Enhance UI: Add tipping history page and vibe score dashboard with animations.
Deliverable: Functional app with NFC tipping, leaderboard, and polished UI on devnet.

Phase 4: Testing & OptimizationConduct unit tests for smart contracts (vibe score logic) and integration tests for Solana Pay.
Optimize transaction costs using Solana’s low fees; ensure gasless BONK tipping via Solana Pay.
Test on Seeker-compatible emulator (Android 14, ARM64 v8a); verify Seed Vault security.
Deliverable: Stable app tested on devnet, ready for testnet deployment.

Phase 5: Deployment & SubmissionDeploy smart contracts to Solana testnet; verify BONK tipping and vibe score functionality.
Finalize UI/UX: Ensure intuitive navigation for crypto newcomers and power users.
Record ~3-minute demo video showcasing wallet integration, BONK tipping (QR/NFC), vibe scores, and BONK leaderboard.
Submit app via Align platform: Include repo link, video, and description emphasizing Seeker and Solana integration.
Prepare app for Solana dApp Store deployment.
Deliverable: App deployed on testnet, hackathon submission completed.

3. Technical RoadmapSmart Contracts (Rust/Anchor):Vibe score contract: Tracks upvotes, calculates scores, and distributes BONK rewards.
BONK tipping contract: Handles micro-transactions with Solana Pay.

Frontend (React Native):Components: Wallet connect, QR scanner, NFC tipping, creator list, leaderboard.
Libraries: @solana/web3.js, @solana-mobile/mobile-wallet-adapter, @solana/pay.

Backend:Use Solana devnet/testnet for testing; Helius API for off-chain data (creator profiles, tipping history).
Optional: Node.js server for caching metadata, if needed for performance.

Seeker-Specific Features:Seed Vault for secure key management.
NFC for tap-to-tip functionality with BONK.
Solana dApp Store for deployment, avoiding centralized app store fees.
